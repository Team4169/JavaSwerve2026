This repository will be used to rewrite the Swerve code in Java.
It is based on the WPILib SwerveBot sample project and YAGSL (Yet Another Generic Swerve Library).

The configuration JSON files can be configured and downloaded from https://broncbotz.org/YAGSL-Example/.

**NOTE: Replace some values in config JSON files with actual values (Swerve module canbus id, grip coefficient, etc.). These files are located in ./src/main/deploy/swerve/
